# Did the family's data get ransacked, or did the mischief only mangle a local copy of the original hash?

# The original munsters hash is altered.

# mess_with_demographics is called with a reference to the original hash and does not make a defensive copy. Operations on "demo_hash" are therefore the same as operations on "munsters"
