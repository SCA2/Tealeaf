You run the following code...

names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'

...and get the following error message:

TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

What is the problem and how can it be fixed?

Ruby can't convert the string 'margaret' into the integer required to index into array 'names'.  One way to get the statement to work is to write

names[names.index('margaret')] = 'jody'

after which names = ["bob", "joe", "susan", "jody"]
